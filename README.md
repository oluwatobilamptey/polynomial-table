## Contract Documentation

### Registry Contract

The registry contract serves as the central database for IoT nodes in the ecosystem.

#### Key Functions

```clarity
(define-public (register-node (name (string-ascii 100)) 
                             (description (string-ascii 500))
                             (location (string-ascii 100))
                             (capabilities (string-ascii 500))
                             (data-types (string-ascii 500))
                             (refresh-rate uint)
                             (price-per-request uint))
```

- Registers a new IoT node with metadata
- Returns the unique node ID

```clarity
(define-public (update-node-status (node-id uint) (new-status uint))
```

- Updates node operational status (active/inactive/maintenance)
- Only callable by node owner

```clarity
(define-public (rate-node (node-id uint) (rating uint))
```

- Allows users to rate nodes (1-5 scale)
- Updates node reputation metrics

### Access Contract

The access contract manages permissions and payment processing for node access.

#### Key Functions

```clarity
(define-public (request-access (node-id uint) 
                              (purpose (string-ascii 100))
                              (duration-blocks uint)
                              (payment-amount uint)
                              (payment-type uint)
                              (payment-interval uint))
```

- Submits request for node access
- Supports one-time and subscription payments

```clarity
(define-public (approve-access (request-id uint))
```

- Approves access request and processes payment
- Only callable by node owner

```clarity
(define-public (verify-access (node-id uint) (requester principal))
```

- Verifies if a requester has valid access to a node
- Used by other contracts for access control

## Security Considerations

- Node owners should carefully verify access requests before approval
- Access permissions are time-bound and can be revoked
- Subscription payments must be maintained to keep access active
- Node reputation should be considered when requesting access
- Contract admin functions should be properly secured in production
